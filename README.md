A simple remake of Flappy bird, for learning purpose

### Unity Editor Interface:    
    âœ…Project panel: it contains everything in our game: sprites, sound effects, scripts, tiles, fonts.
    âœ…Hierarchy panel: it contains all the stuff (game objects) which are in the current scene. In most games it would be a level.
            -> A game object: an invisible container, it has a position in space, a rotation and a scale. It gets filled with components to add extra feautures.
            ðŸ‘‰ "GameObject = thing in your game scene"
            ðŸ‘‰ "Hierarchy = list of all those things in the scene"

    âœ…Inspector panel: used to inspect & modify a game object.
