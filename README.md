### Unity Editor Interface:    
    ✅Project panel: it contains everything in our game: sprites, sound effects, scripts, tiles, fonts 
    ✅Hierarchy panel: it contains all the stuff which are in the current scene, which in most games it would be a level
            -> A game object: an invisible container, it has a position in space, a rotation and a scale. It gets filled with components to add extra feautures.
